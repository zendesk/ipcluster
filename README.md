IPCluster
=========

IPCluster is a "bare-metal" library for Node.js to manage multi-core concurrency, with sticky sessions and zero-downtime reloading.

Features
--------
* Sticky sessions (via iptables abuse) - suitable for long-polling
* Configurable per-process and cluster memory limits
* Graceful shutdowns and restarts
* Renice older workers

Dependencies
------------
* npm modules - q, toobusy-js, lodash

_IPCluster sticky sessions currently requires `iptables` for sticky sessions and so is Linux-only_

Setup
=====

npm dependencies
----------------
    npm install

iptables sudo support
---------------------
sudo iptables support is required in order to support sticky sessions.

Add to sudoers (visudo):

    <node> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/iptables -t nat -L
    <node> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/iptables -t nat -[ID] PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp -s 0.0.0.*/0.0.0.* -d * --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports ?????
    <node> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/iptables -t nat -[ID] PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp -s 0.0.0.*/0.0.0.* -d * --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports ?????
etc. for other ports

Change `<node>` to the running user.

Thankfully, iptables does not allow duplicate copies of most flags, so that the `*` wildcards can't be abused (much). Nonetheless, sercurity feedback is welcome. An alternative for `*` would be appreciated.

Usage
=====
    npm install ipcluster --save

See https://github.com/zopim/ipcluster-example for a simple example.

In your application
-------------------

### Deploying new code / Running a new batch of workers

Once you app is ipcluster-enabled, starting it should start a master that will spawn multiple workers. The workers are _not_ child processes (they will outlive the master).

To start a new batch a workers (e.g. when you are deployig new code), you should kill off the old master, and start a new master. The old workers will still be running happily.

Restarting a new master will do 2 things:
  - Spawn a new generation of workers, running your latest code for all new incoming connections
  - Become the master for all old workers, and manage their retirement and (eventual) destruction

Note: you can restart a new master without first killing the old one. The new master will find and terminate the old master as part of its boot up sequence.

Signals
-------
The master process understands these signals:
  - `SIGUSR1`: Kills all retired workers.

Contributing
============

git pre-commit hook
-------------------
Being a JS project, we require the code to be lint free, based on our Zopim's jshint rules (see the file .jshtinrc at the root of the project for details)

### Installing jshint

Make sure you add "/usr/local/share/npm/bin" to your PATH, and then do the install as follow:

    # installing jshint
    npm install jshint -g

    # testing install, should show "jshint vX.Y.Z"
    jshint -version

### Running jshint

Run jshint on the whole source tree

    jshint lib

Testing
-------
ipcluster contains some unit tests made with [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit) (with many more to come, thanks to **you**!). The tests can be run with [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), the task runner. At the root of the project run:

    grunt test

Do run the test suite (which also run jshint), prior to committing.

Installing grunt
----------------
    npm install -g grunt-cli
